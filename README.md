# 👋 Hello there, welcome to my GitHub page!
I'm Gianfranco, a dedicated Web Developer with a passion for continuous learning and
problem-solving. My skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Bootstrap,
SQL, React, Django. I transitioned into software development through a Level 4 Full Stack
Web Development Bootcamp at Step8Up Academy, where I gained hands-on
experience in building modern, responsive and user-friendly web applications. I'm
excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to new challenges in the tech industry.
